=======
Web-framework for web-applications, also features multi-domain content management with redundancy elimination .

## Under Construction

As I was often asked to make the PHP version open source, this new rewrite will be free software from the beginning,
if you are unhappy with GPLv3, write me an email, we can arrange a dual-license for your business case.
